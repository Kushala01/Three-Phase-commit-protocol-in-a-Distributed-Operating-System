## Abstract & Objectives

The abstract outlines the architecture and objectives of the chatroom system, emphasizing real-time communication, user authentication, GUI development, error handling, and scalability.

## Problem Statement

The problem statement highlights the challenges in managing distributed transactions and introduces the implementation of the Three-Phase Commit (3PC) protocol to address these challenges effectively.

## Technologies Used

Python, socket programming, tkinter (GUI library), threading, datetime module, and networking concepts are utilized to develop the chatroom system and integrate the 3PC protocol.

## Methodology

The methodology section details the approach followed, including understanding requirements, component breakdown, architectural design, implementation of chat server and GUI, and integration of the 3PC protocol.

## Results Obtained

Results showcase the successful implementation of the chatroom system and the 3PC protocol, emphasizing real-time communication, reliable transaction management, fault tolerance, and error handling.

## Limitations

The limitations section discusses scalability challenges, lack of persistence, limited error handling, and security concerns within the chatroom system.

## Future Work

Future work suggestions include integrating advanced features like enhanced authentication, message filtering, scalability optimization, external service integration, UI refinement, and logging/analytics capabilities.
